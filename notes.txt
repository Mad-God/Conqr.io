GAME CREATION:
    considerations:
        make everything a seperate object; dino, tree, game
        make every event a diffrent method; jump, add tree, delete tree, collision, score?, 
        make a mechanism to keep game status; score, number of trees jumped
        make a restart feature; remove all trees; set score to zero, number of tress jumped zero


TRAINING:
    training:
        considerations:
            input to be given to the NN: next closest tree distance, speed, current position of dino
            how to pass the output of the NN to the game: jump or not jump
            update the inputs to be passed to the NN on every tick
            calculate the fitness of the NN genome after game end or some interval
            a mechanism to pass the genomes to the game
            a mechanism to test the best NN genome
